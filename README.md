# Drowsiness-Detection-System
 Drowsiness detection using OpenCV and Python.
This project is to aimed to develop a system for detecting and preventing drowsiness in real-time.
Driver’s fatigue causes maximum number of accidents. Drowsiness detection reduces the car accidents and increases the safety of driver. Various studies states that around 30-40% accidents occur due to drowsy driver. The development of technology allows introducing more advanced solutions in everyday life. This makes work less exhausting for employees and increases the work safety. Now a day’s vision-based systems are more popular, and it is used in different application. Detection of drowsiness involves an observation of a face, detection of eye position and the observation of eye blinking pattern. The analysis of face images is done by using a “shape predictor containing 68-facelandmarks”. To detect fatigue, a webcam has been used which points directly towards face and detect eye movement. In this the project the main focus was on the blinking pattern of the eyes, which involves looking at the entire image of the face, and determining the position of the eyes, by a developed image processing algorithm. Once the position of the eyes is located, the system is designed to determine whether the eyes are opened or closed and detect drowsiness. If the eyes are closed for particular time period, the alarm will play to alert the driver.
